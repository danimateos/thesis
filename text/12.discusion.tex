The results presented here represent the first \ac{GW} view of \ac{TALE} family proteins \acp{BS} in the vertebrate embryo. As such, they deepen our understanding of the target sequences and modes of action of these Hox cofactors, and raise interesting questions that will have to be addressed in further studies.
