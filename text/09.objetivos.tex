  \item Identify TALE protein binding sites in the genome during embryogenesis.
  
  \item Characterize the binding sites with regards to their epigenetic and conservation features.
  
  \item Characterize the DNA sequences bouind by the TALE proteins \textit{in vivo}.
  
  \item Characterize the transcriptional effect of TALE protein binding.
  
  \item Characterize the combinatorial binding of the TALE proteins.
