\chapter{Objectives}
\label{chp:objectives}

Further study of how the \ac{TALE} proteins exert their various physiological and pathological effects is limited by sparse knowledge of their targets. DNA binding is a core aspect of the function of any \ac{TF}, but in the case of the \ac{TALE} proteins we only have \ac{GW} data about their binding either \textit{in vitro} or in cell lines. In this thesis, we aimed to characterize \ac{TALE} protein \textit{in vivo} DNA binding requirements as deeply as possible. We divided this aim into the following concrete objectives:

\begin{itemize}
%[MT: include a couple of sentences highlinting why this is a relevant objective]

  \item Identify TALE protein binding sites in the genome during embryogenesis, as the necessary first step.
  
  \item Characterize the binding sites with regards to their epigenetic and conservation features.% Particular patterns of histone marks and/or high conservation can indicate functional relevance and hint at particular mechanisms of action.
  
  \item Characterize the DNA sequences bound by the TALE proteins \textit{in vivo}.  
  
  \item Characterize the transcriptional effect of TALE protein binding.  
  
  \item Characterize the combinatorial binding of the TALE proteins.
  
  
  
\end{itemize}
