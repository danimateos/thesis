		1.3 the need for cofactors


	2. history and general perspective of Hox cofactors

Pbx was identified in Drosophila in 1990 as extradenticle {Peifer and Wieschaus 1990} and proposed as a Hox protein cofactor based on phenotype. In parallel, it was identified as the DNA binding part of the chimeric protein produced by the t(1;19) translocation found in human pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia {Kamps et al 1990}. 
Meis1 was identified in 1995 as a proto-oncogene locus in which the ecotropic murine leukemia is inserted in BXH-2 mice {Moskow et al. 1995}. Homothorax was identified in {Rieckhof et al. 1997} as a Drosophila homolog of Meis1 required for Exd nuclear localization. 
Prep1 was identified in 1198 as a component of the urokinase enhancer factor 3 capable of forming a DNA binding-independent heterodimer with Pbx1 {Berthelsen et al. 1998}.
