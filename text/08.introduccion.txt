	1. history and general perspective of Hox cofactors

Pbx was identified in Drosophila in 1990 as extradenticle {Peifer and Wieschaus 1990} and proposed as a Hox protein cofactor based on phenotype. In parallel, it was identified as the DNA binding part of the chimeric protein produced by the t(1;19) translocation found in human pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia {Kamps et al 1990}
Meis was identified in 199
Prep was identified in
