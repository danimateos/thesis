  abstract = {homothorax (hth) is a Drosophila member of the Meis family of homeobox
	genes. hth function is required for the nuclear localization of the
	Hox cofactor Extradenticle (EXD). We show here that there is also
	a post-transcriptional control of HTH by exd: exd activity is required
	for the apparent stability of the HTH protein. In leg imaginal discs,
	hth expression is limited to the domain of exd function and this
	domain is complementary to the domain in which the Wingless (WG)
	and Decapentaplegic (DPP) signals are active. We demonstrate that
	WG and DPP act together through their targets Distal-less (Dll) and
	dachshund (dac) to restrict hth expression, and therefore EXD's nuclear
	localization, to the most proximal regions of the leg disc. Furthermore,
	there is a reciprocal repression exerted by HTH on these and other
	DPP and WG downstream targets that restricts their expression to
	non-hth-expressing cells. Thus, there exists in the leg disc a set
	of mutually antagonistic interactions between proximal cells, which
	we define as those that express hth, and distal cells, or those that
	do not express hth. In addition, we show that dac negatively regulates
	Dll. We suggest that these antagonistic relationships help to convert
	the WG and DPP activity gradients into discreet domains of gene expression
	along the proximodistal axis.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila PBC protein Extradenticle (Exd) is regulated at the
	level of its subcellular distribution: It is cytoplasmic in the absence
	of Homothorax (Hth), a Meis family member, and nuclear in the presence
	of Hth. Here we present evidence that, in the absence of Hth, Exd
	is exported from nuclei due to the activity of a nuclear export signal
	(NES). The activity of this NES is inhibited by the antibiotic Leptomycin
	B, suggesting that Exd is exported by a CRM1/exportin1-related export
	pathway. By analyzing the subcellular localization of Exd deletion
	mutants in imaginal discs and cultured cells, we identified three
	elements in Exd, a putative NES, a nuclear localization sequence
	(NLS), and a region required for Hth-mediated nuclear localization.
	This latter region coincides with a domain in Exd that binds Hth
	protein in vitro. When Exd is uncomplexed with Hth, the NES dominates
	over the NLS. When Exd is expressed together with Hth, or when the
	NES is deleted, Exd is nuclear. Thus, Hth is required to overcome
	the influence of the NES, possibly by inducing a conformational change
	in Exd. Finally, we provide evidence that Hth and Exd normally interact
	in the cytoplasm, and that Hth also has an NLS. We propose that in
	Exd there exists a balance between the activities of an NES and an
	NLS, and that Hth alters this balance in favor of the NLS.},

  abstract = {Hox genes are major determinants of the animal body plan, where they

	mouse limb development, Hoxd genes are transcribed in two waves:
	early on, when the arm and forearm are specified, and later, when
	digits form. The transition between early and late regulations involves
	a functional switch between two opposite topological domains. This
	switch is reflected by a subset of Hoxd genes mapping centrally into
	the cluster, which initially interact with the telomeric domain and
	subsequently swing toward the centromeric domain, where they establish
	new contacts. This transition between independent regulatory landscapes
	illustrates both the modularity of the limbs and the distinct evolutionary
	histories of its various pieces. It also allows the formation of
	an intermediate area of low HOX proteins content, which develops
	into the wrist, the transition between our arms and our hands. This
	regulatory strategy accounts for collinear Hox gene regulation in
	land vertebrate appendages.},

	interactions across 130 kb of chromatin containing the mouse alpha-globin
	cluster in cells representing all stages of differentiation from
	stem cells to mature erythroblasts. The alpha-gene cluster appears
	to be inert in pluripotent cells, but priming of expression begins
	in multipotent haemopoietic progenitors via GATA-2. In committed
	erythroid progenitors, GATA-2 is replaced by GATA-1 and binding is
	extended to additional sites including the alpha-globin promoters.
	Both GATA-1 and GATA-2 nucleate the binding of various protein complexes
	including SCL/LMO2/E2A/Ldb-1 and NF-E2. Changes in protein/DNA binding
	are accompanied by sequential alterations in long-range histone acetylation
	and methylation. The recruitment of polymerase II, which ultimately
	leads to a rapid increase in alpha-globin transcription, occurs late
	in maturation. These studies provide detailed evidence for the more
	general hypothesis that commitment and differentiation are primarily
	driven by the sequential appearance of key transcriptional factors,

	blood vascular system. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized the
	vascular patterning defects of mice deficient for the homeodomain
	transcription factor Meis1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site
	1), which completely lack megakaryocyte/platelets. Meis1 null embryos
	fail to separate the blood and lymphatic vasculature, showing blood-filled
	primary lymphatic sacs and superficial lymphatic vessels. To test
	the involvement of megakaryocytes/platelets in this phenotype, we
	generated megakaryocyte/platelet-specific deficient mice by targeted
	lineage ablation, without affecting other blood lineages. This model
	reproduces the lymphatic/blood vasculature separation defects observed
	in Meis1 mutants. A similar phenotype was induced by antibody-mediated
	ablation of circulating platelets in wild type mice. Strong association
	of platelets with vascular endothelium at regions of contact between
	lymphatic sacs and veins confirmed a direct role of platelets in
	the separation of the 2 vasculatures. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to
	their known protective function in the response accidental vascular
	injury, platelets are also required during embryonic lymphangiogenesis
	for the separation of the nascent lymphatic vasculature from blood

	proteins that control developmental fates by differentially regulating
	the transcription of downstream target genes. Despite their unique
	in vivo functions, disparate HOX proteins often bind to very similar
	DNA sequences in vitro. Thus, a critical question is how HOX proteins
	select the correct sets of target genes in vivo. The homeodomain
	proteins encoded by the Drosophila extradenticle gene and its mammalian
	homologues, the pbx genes, contribute to HOX specificity by cooperatively
	binding to DNA with HOX proteins. For example, the HOX protein labial
	cooperatively binds with extradenticle protein to a 20-bp oligonucleotide
	that is sufficient to direct a labial-like expression pattern in
	Drosophila embryos. Here we have analyzed the protein-DNA interactions
	that are important for forming the labial-extradenticle-DNA complex.
	The data suggest a model in which labial and extradenticle, separated
	by only 4 bp, bind this DNA as a heterodimer in a head-to-tail orientation.
	We have confirmed several aspects of this model by characterizing
	extradenticle-HOX binding to mutant oligonucleotides. Most importantly,
	mutations in base pairs predicted to contact the HOX N-terminal arm
	resulted in a change in HOX preference in the heterodimer, from labial
	to Ultrabithorax. These results demonstrate that extradenticle prefers
	to bind cooperatively with different HOX proteins depending on subtle

	reports that Pbx1 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors during

	anemia and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 15 (E15) or E16.
	Definitive myeloerythroid lineages are present in Pbx1(-/-) fetal

	qualitative defects in the most primitive multilineage progenitors

	Pbx1(-/-) embryos have reduced colony-forming activity and are unable
	to establish multilineage hematopoiesis in competitive reconstitution
	experiments. Common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), the earliest known
	myeloerythroid-restricted progenitors, are markedly depleted in Pbx1(-/-)
	embryos at E14 and display clonogenic defects in erythroid colony
	formation. Comparative cell-cycle indexes suggest that these defects
	result largely from insufficient proliferation. Megakaryocyte- and
	erythrocyte-committed progenitors are also reduced in number and

	these data indicate that Pbx1 is essential for the function of hematopoietic
	progenitors with erythropoietic potential and that its loss creates
	a proliferative constriction at the level of the CMP. Thus, Pbx1

	on genetic mosaics confirm the idea that the genetic information

	mutants in mosaics suggests the existence of at least two classes

	Those of a second group (selector genes) seem to control developmental
	pathways and share several operational characteristics. A functional
	scheme is advanced showing how selector genes may become activated

	In this way signals extrinsic to the genome become translated into
	genetic ones. The activation, or repression, of selector genes occurs
	once in development and remains clonally irreversible. This, possibly,

	Recombinant Pbx1 and Prep1 proteins bind cooperatively to the UE-A

	(NLSs) within the PBX HD are masked by intramolecular contacts. In
	a screen to identify additional proteins directing PBX subcellular
	localization, we identified a fragment of murine nonmuscle myosin

	and PBX.HOX heterodimers. We have shown previously that transcriptional
	activation by PBX.HOX is augmented by either protein kinase A (PKA)
	or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). To examine
	the contribution of MEIS proteins to this response, we used the chromatin
	immunoprecipitation assay to show that MEIS1 in addition to PBX1,
	HOXA1, and HOXB1 was recruited to a known PBX.HOX target, the Hoxb1
	autoregulatory element following Hoxb1 transcriptional activation
	in P19 cells. Subsequent to TSA treatment, MEIS1 recruitment lagged
	behind that of HOX and PBX partners. MEIS1A also enhanced the transcriptional
	activation of a reporter construct bearing the Hoxb1 autoregulatory
	element after treatment with TSA. The MEIS1 homeodomain and protein-protein
	interaction with PBX contributed to this activity. We further mapped
	TSA-responsive and CREB-binding protein-dependent PKA-responsive
	transactivation domains to the MEIS1A and MEIS1B C termini. Fine
	mutation of the 56-residue MEIS1A C terminus revealed four discrete
	regions required for transcriptional activation function. All of
	the mutations impairing the response to TSA likewise reduced activation
	by PKA, implying a common mechanistic basis. C-terminal deletion
	of MEIS1 impaired transactivation without disrupting DNA binding
	or complex formation with HOX and PBX. Despite sequence similarity
	to MEIS and a shared ability to form heteromeric complexes with PBX
	and HOX partners, the PREP1 C terminus does not respond to TSA or

	Conditional Hoxa9 activation is associated with CBP/P300 recruitment,

	intron-rich homeodomain-containing transcription factors involved

	surprising results that suggest important and very different functions
	for Meis intron-exon structures. First, we find unexpected conservation
	across species of intron positions and lengths along most of the
	Meis locus. This contrasts with the high degree of structural divergence
	found in genome-wide studies and may attest to conserved regulatory
	elements residing within these conserved introns. Second, we find
	very different evolutionary histories for the 5' and 3' regions of
	the gene. The 5'-most 10 exons, which encode the highly conserved
	Meis domain and homeodomain, show striking conservation. By contrast,
	the 3' of the gene, which encodes several domains implicated in transcriptional
	activation and response to cell signaling, shows a remarkably active
	evolutionary history, with diverse isoforms and frequent creation
	and loss of new exons and splice sites. This region-specific diversity
	suggests evolutionary "tinkering," with alternative splicing allowing
	for more subtle regulation of protein function. Third, we find a
	large number of cases of convergent evolution in the 3' region, including
	1) parallel losses of ancestral coding sequence, 2) parallel gains
	of external and internal splice sites, and 3) recurrent truncation
	of C-terminal coding regions. These results attest to the importance

	in conjunction with a distal Meis site, which we showed to be required
	for ternary complex formation and Meis-enhanced transcription. Formation
	of heterotrimeric complexes in which all three homeodomains bind
	their cognate DNA sites is topologically facilitated by the ability
	of Pbx and Meis to interact through their amino termini and bind
	DNA without stringent half-site orientation and spacing requirements.
	Furthermore, Meis site mutation in the Hoxb2 enhancer phenocopies
	Pbx-Hox site mutation to abrogate enhancer-directed expression of

	of homeodomain transcription factors, which are components of hetero-oligomeric
	protein complexes thought to regulate developmental gene expression
	and to maintain differentiated cell states. In vitro studies have
	shown that Pbx1 regulates the activity of Ipf1 (also known as Pdx1),
	a ParaHox homeodomain transcription factor required for the development
	and function of the pancreas in mice and humans. To investigate in
	vivo roles of Pbx1 in pancreatic development and function, we examined
	pancreatic Pbx1 expression, and morphogenesis, cell differentiation
	and function in mice deficient for Pbx1. Pbx1-/- embryos had pancreatic
	hypoplasia and marked defects in exocrine and endocrine cell differentiation
	prior to death at embryonic day (E) 15 or E16. In these embryos,
	expression of Isl1 and Atoh5, essential regulators of pancreatic
	morphogenesis and differentiation, was severely reduced. Pbx1+/-
	adults had pancreatic islet malformations, impaired glucose tolerance
	and hypoinsulinemia. Thus, Pbx1 is essential for normal pancreatic
	development and function. Analysis of trans-heterozygous Pbx1+/-
	Ipf1+/- mice revealed in vivo genetic interactions between Pbx1 and
	Ipf1 that are essential for postnatal pancreatic function; these
	mice developed age-dependent overt diabetes mellitus, unlike Pbx1+/-
	or Ipf1+/- mice. Mutations affecting the Ipf1 protein may promote
	diabetes mellitus in mice and humans. This study suggests that perturbation
	of Pbx1 activity may also promote susceptibility to diabetes mellitus.},

	There are three Pbx family members, which bind DNA as heterodimers

	the tryptophan-interaction pocket of the Pbx component of a Pbx-Meis/Prep1

	Likewise, in murine myeloid leukemia, transcriptional coactivation

	Here, we identify a putative Hox-Pbx responsive cis-regulatory sequence,

	component of Hoxa2 regulation in rhombomere (r) 4. By using cell
	transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we

	Hoxa2 r4 intronic enhancer and that its integrity is required to
	drive specific reporter gene expression in r4 upon electroporation
	in the chick embryo hindbrain. Thus, both intronic as well as exonic
	regulatory sequences are involved in Hoxa2 segmental regulation in
	the developing r4. Finally, we found that the Hox-Pbx exonic element
	is embedded in a larger 205-bp long ultraconserved genomic element

  abstract = {RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured.
	A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is
	the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This
	issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome
	assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult
	to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second
	significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms
	of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from
	one or both ends of cDNA fragments.We present RSEM, an user-friendly
	software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from
	single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates,
	95\% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also
	simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software
	does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a
	de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript
	quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated
	and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to
	quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage
	of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we
	show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained
	with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand,
	estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes
	may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on
	the number of possible splice forms for each gene.RSEM is an accurate
	and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances
	from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference
	genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo
	transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable
	guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments
	with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

  abstract = {The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing
	technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment
	programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been
	developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast
	enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ
	does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes
	it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur
	frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment
	is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.We implemented
	Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package
	that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT),
	to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference
	sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps.
	BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing
	machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations
	on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately
	10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
	BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)
	format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment
	can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide analyses of protein binding sites generate large amounts
	of data; a ChIP dataset might contain 10,000 sites. Unbiased motif
	discovery in such datasets is not generally feasible using current
	methods that employ probabilistic models. We propose an efficient
	method, GADEM, which combines spaced dyads and an expectation-maximization
	(EM) algorithm. Candidate words (four to six nucleotides) for constructing
	spaced dyads are prioritized by their degree of overrepresentation
	in the input sequence data. Spaced dyads are converted into starting
	position weight matrices (PWMs). GADEM then employs a genetic algorithm
	(GA), with an embedded EM algorithm to improve starting PWMs, to
	guide the evolution of a population of spaced dyads toward one whose
	entropy scores are more statistically significant. Spaced dyads whose
	entropy scores reach a pre-specified significance threshold are declared
	motifs. GADEM performed comparably with MEME on 500 sets of simulated
	"ChIP" sequences with embedded known P53 binding sites. The major
	advantage of GADEM is its computational efficiency on large ChIP
	datasets compared to competitors. We applied GADEM to six genome-wide
	ChIP datasets. Approximately, 15 to 30 motifs of various lengths
	were identified in each dataset. Remarkably, without any prior motif
	information, the expected known motif (e.g., P53 in P53 data) was
	identified every time. GADEM discovered motifs of various lengths
	(6-40 bp) and characteristics in these datasets containing from 0.5
	to >13 million nucleotides with run times of 5 to 96 h. GADEM can
	be viewed as an extension of the well-known MEME algorithm and is
	an efficient tool for de novo motif discovery in large-scale genome-wide
	data. The GADEM software is available at (www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/GADEM/).},

  abstract = {To bind DNA and to be retained in the nucleus, PBX proteins must form
	heterodimeric complexes with members of the MEINOX family. Therefore
	the balance between PBX and MEINOX must be an important regulatory
	feature. We show that overexpression of PREP-1 influences the level
	of PBX-2 protein maintaining the PREP-1-PBX balance. This effect
	has important functional consequences. F9 teratocarcinoma cells stably
	transfected with PREP-1 had an increased DNA binding activity to
	a PREP-PBX-responsive element. Because PREP-1 binds DNA efficiently
	only when dimerized to PBX, the increased DNA binding activity suggests
	that the level of PBX might also have increased. Indeed PREP-1-overexpressing
	cells had a higher level of PBX-2 and PBX-1b proteins. PBX-2 increase
	did not depend on increased mRNA level or a higher rate of translation
	but rather because of a protein stabilization process. Indeed, PBX-2
	level drastically decreased after 3 h of cycloheximide treatment
	in control but not in PREP-1-overexpressing cells and the proteasome
	inhibitor MG132 prevented PBX-2 decay in control cells. Hence, dimerization
	with PREP-1 appears to decrease proteasomal degradation of PBX-2.
	Retinoic acid induces differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells
	with a cascade synthesis of HOX proteins. In PREP-1-overexpressing
	cells, HOXb1 induction was more sustained (3 days versus 1 day) and
	the induced level of MEIS-1b, another TALE (three amino acid loop
	extension) protein involved in embryonal development, was higher.
	Thus an increase in PREP-1 leads to changes in the fate-determining
	HOXb1 and has therefore important functional consequences.},

	these are established is still ill-defined. PBX1 is a TALE homeodomain
	protein involved in the development of different types of cancers.
	The estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) is central to the development
	of two-thirds of all breast cancers. Here we demonstrate that PBX1
	acts as a pioneer factor and is essential for the ER alpha-mediated
	transcriptional response driving aggressive tumors in breast cancer.
	Indeed, PBX1 expression correlates with ER alpha in primary breast
	tumors, and breast cancer cells depleted of PBX1 no longer proliferate
	following estrogen stimulation. Profiling PBX1 recruitment and chromatin
	accessibility across the genome of breast cancer cells through ChIP-seq
	and FAIRE-seq reveals that PBX1 is loaded and promotes chromatin
	openness at specific genomic locations through its capacity to read
	specific epigenetic signatures. Accordingly, PBX1 guides ER alpha
	recruitment to a specific subset of sites. Expression profiling studies
	demonstrate that PBX1 controls over 70\% of the estrogen response.
	More importantly, the PBX1-dependent transcriptional program is associated
	with poor-outcome in breast cancer patients. Correspondingly, PBX1
	expression alone can discriminate a priori the outcome in ER alpha-positive
	breast cancer patients. These features are markedly different from
	the previously characterized ER alpha-associated pioneer factor FoxA1.
	Indeed, PBX1 is the only pioneer factor identified to date that discriminates
	outcome such as metastasis in ER alpha-positive breast cancer patients.
	Together our results reveal that PBX1 is a novel pioneer factor defining
	aggressive ER alpha-positive breast tumors, as it guides ER alpha
	genomic activity to unique genomic regions promoting a transcriptional
	program favorable to breast cancer progression.},

	regenerative capacity is lost by postnatal day 7 and the mechanisms
	of cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest remain unclear. The homeodomain
	transcription factor Meis1 is required for normal cardiac development
	but its role in cardiomyocytes is unknown. Here we identify Meis1

	in mouse cardiomyocytes was sufficient for extension of the postnatal
	proliferative window of cardiomyocytes, and for re-activation of
	cardiomyocyte mitosis in the adult heart with no deleterious effect
	on cardiac function. In contrast, overexpression of Meis1 in cardiomyocytes
	decreased neonatal myocyte proliferation and inhibited neonatal heart
	regeneration. Finally, we show that Meis1 is required for transcriptional
	activation of the synergistic CDK inhibitors p15, p16 and p21. These

	retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated transcription. RAR is thought
	to bind the genome constitutively, and only induce transcription
	in the presence of the retinoid ligand. However, little is known
	about where RAR binds to the genome or how it selects target sites.We
	tested the constitutive RAR binding model using the retinoic acid-driven
	differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into differentiated

	changes in RAR genomic binding, including novel binding to genes
	directly responsible for anterior-posterior specification, as well
	as the subsequent recruitment of the basal polymerase machinery.
	Finally, we discovered that the binding of transcription factors
	at the embryonic stem cell stage can accurately predict where in
	the genome RAR binds after initial differentiation.We have characterized
	a ligand-dependent shift in RAR genomic occupancy at the initiation

	roles in the segmental processes that regulate anteroposterior (AP)
	patterning. Paralogous Hox genes, such as Hoxa3, Hoxb3 and Hoxd3,
	generally have very similar patterns of expression, and gene targeting
	experiments have shown that members of paralogy group 3 can functionally
	compensate for each other. Hence, distinct functions for individual
	members of this family may primarily depend upon differences in their
	expression domains. The earliest domains of expression of the Hoxa3
	and Hoxb3 genes in hindbrain rhombomeric (r) segments are transiently
	regulated by kreisler, a conserved Maf b-Zip protein, but the mechanisms
	that maintain expression in later stages are unknown. In this study,
	we have compared the segmental expression and regulation of Hoxa3
	and Hoxb3 in mouse and chick embryos to investigate how they are
	controlled after initial activation. We found that the patterns of
	Hoxa3 and Hoxb3 expression in r5 and r6 in later stages during mouse
	and chick hindbrain development were differentially regulated. Hoxa3
	expression was maintained in r5 and r6, while Hoxb3 was downregulated.
	Regulatory comparisons of cis-elements from the chick and mouse Hoxa3
	locus in both transgenic mouse and chick embryos have identified
	a conserved enhancer that mediates the late phase of Hoxa3 expression
	through a conserved auto/cross-regulatory loop. This block of similarity
	is also present in the human and horn shark loci, and contains two
	bipartite Hox/Pbx-binding sites that are necessary for its in vivo
	activity in the hindbrain. These HOX/PBC sites are positioned near
	a conserved kreisler-binding site (KrA) that is involved in activating
	early expression in r5 and r6, but their activity is independent
	of kreisler. This work demonstrates that separate elements are involved
	in initiating and maintaining Hoxa3 expression during hindbrain segmentation,
	and that it is regulated in a manner different from Hoxb3 in later
	stages. Together, these findings add further strength to the emerging
	importance of positive auto- and cross-regulatory interactions between
	Hox genes as a general mechanism for maintaining their correct spatial
	patterns in the vertebrate nervous system.},

	Furthermore, we show that Pbx proteins directly bind the promoter
	of the myocardial differentiation gene myl7 in vitro, supporting
	a direct role for Pbx proteins in promoting cardiac muscle differentiation.
	Our findings demonstrate new roles for Pbx proteins in vertebrate

	Furthermore, we show that Sonic hedgehog requires Myod in order to

	and anteroposterior axes. However, the molecular mechanism by which
	limb cells acquire their proximodistal (P-D) identity is unknown.
	Here we describe the role of the homeobox genes Meis1/2 and Pbx1
	in the development of mouse, chicken and Drosophila limbs. We find
	that Meis1/2 expression is restricted to a proximal domain, coincident
	with the previously reported domain in which Pbx1 is localized to
	the nucleus, and resembling the distribution of the Drosophila homologues
	homothorax (hth) and extradenticle (exd); that Meis1 regulates Pbx1
	activity by promoting nuclear import of the Pbx1 protein; and that
	ectopic expression of Meis1 in chicken and hth in Drosophila disrupts
	distal limb development and induces distal-to-proximal transformations.
	We suggest that restriction of Meis1/Hth to proximal regions of the
	vertebrate and insect limb is essential to specify cell fates and
	differentiation patterns along the P-D axis of the limb.},

	all the thoracic and abdominal segments resemble mesothoracic segments.
	This observation, together with the segmental specificity of the

	in which the type of development in each segment is specified by
	the activation of a fraction of the total number of bithorax genes.
	Thus, lack of activity of the bithorax genes results in mesothoracic
	development, activation of the bithorax (bx+) and postbithorax (pbx+)
	genes produces metathorax (anterior and posterior respectively),
	and activation of these two genes with bithoraxoid (bxd+) produces

	In embryos with reduced levels of extradenticle gene product, anterior

	identities are altered. Even when homeotic proteins are ectopically
	expressed under the control of a heterologous promoter, extradenticle
	mutations affect their consequences. Thus, in the absence of sufficient
	extradenticle product, altered segmental morphology results from
	alteration of the functional consequences of specific homeo domain
	proteins, possibly through alterations in their target gene specificity.
	extradenticle is also expressed maternally. Complete removal of extradenticle,

	A low percentage of homozygous Prep1(i/i) mice survived at birth,

	mice contained fewer alphabetaTCR mature T cells and more gammadeltaTCR
	T cells than wild-type littermates. Moreover, Prep1(i/i) CD4(+) CD8(+)
	double-positive thymocytes underwent more apoptosis, and SP thymocytes
	proliferated less than control littermates. Mice that were lethally

	We show here that in insect cells the mammalian homolog of EXD, PBX1A,
	shows a similar dependence on the HTH homologs MEIS1, 2, and 3 and
	the MEIS-like protein PREP1. Paradoxically, removal of residues N-terminal
	to the PBX1A HD abolishes interactions with MEIS/PREP but allows

	to green fluorescent protein to map two cooperative nuclear localization
	signals (NLSs) in the PBX HD. The results of DNA-binding assays and
	pull-down experiments are consistent with a model whereby the PBX
	N-terminus binds to the HD and masks the two NLSs. In support of
	the model, a mutation in the PBX HD that disrupts contact with the
	N-terminus leads to constitutive nuclear localization. The HD mutation
	also increases sensitivity to protease digestion, consistent with
	a change in conformation. We propose that MEIS family proteins induce
	a conformational change in PBX that unmasks the NLS, leading to nuclear

	Despite the presence of HOXB1 and PBX1, this enhancer fails to activate

	Activation requires cell aggregation in addition to RA. This suggests
	that HOX-PBX complexes may repress transcription under some conditions.
	Consistent with this, multimerized HOX-PBX binding sites repress
	reporter gene expression in HEK293 cells. We provide a mechanistic
	basis for repressor function by demonstrating that a corepressor
	complex, including histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 3, mSIN3B,
	and N-CoR/SMRT, interacts with PBX1A. We map a site of interaction
	with HDAC1 to the PBX1 N terminus and show that the PBX partner is
	required for repression by the HOX-PBX complex. Treatment with the
	deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A not only relieves repression
	but also converts the HOX-PBX complex to a net activator of transcription.
	We show that this activation function is mediated by the recruitment
	of the coactivator CREB-binding protein by the HOX partner. Interestingly,
	HOX-PBX complexes are switched from transcriptional repressors to
	activators in response to protein kinase A signaling or cell aggregation.
	Together, our results suggest a model whereby the HOX-PBX complex
	can act as a repressor or activator of transcription via association
	with corepressors and coactivators. The model implies that cell signaling

	Rather, structure-function analyses demonstrate that domains of HoxA9

	the amino terminus of HoxA9 provides essential transcriptional effector

	to form in vitro cooperative DNA binding complexes with either the
	PBX or MEIS protein. Furthermore, PBX and MEIS proteins have been
	shown to form in vivo heterodimeric DNA binding complexes with each
	other. We now show that in vitro DNA site selection for MEIS1 in
	the presence of HOXA9 and PBX yields a consensus PBX-HOXA9 site.
	MEIS1 enhances in vitro HOXA9-PBX protein complex formation in the
	absence of DNA and forms a trimeric electrophoretic mobility shift
	assay (EMSA) complex with these proteins on an oligonucleotide containing
	a PBX-HOXA9 site. Myeloid cell nuclear extracts produce EMSA complexes
	which appear to contain HOXA9, PBX2, and MEIS1, while immunoprecipitation
	of HOXA9 from these extracts results in coprecipitation of PBX2 and
	MEIS1. In myeloid cells, HOXA9, MEIS1, and PBX2 are all strongly
	expressed in the nucleus, where a portion of their signals are colocalized
	within nuclear speckles. However, cotransfection of HOXA9 and PBX2
	with or without MEIS1 minimally influences transcription of a reporter
	gene containing multiple PBX-HOXA9 binding sites. Taken together,
	these data suggest that in myeloid leukemia cells MEIS1 forms trimeric
	complexes with PBX and HOXA9, which in turn can bind to consensus
	PBX-HOXA9 DNA targets.},

	Binding site selection for Hoxb-9 with Pbx1a yielded ATGATTTACGAC,
	containing a novel TTAC Hox-binding site adjacent to a Pbx site.
	In the presence of Pbx1a, Hoxb-9 and Hoxa-10 bound to targets containing
	either TTAC or TTAT. These data extend previous findings that interactions
	with Pbx define a Hox protein binding code for different DNA sequences
	across paralog groups 1 through 10. Members of the 11, 12, and 13
	paralogs do not cooperatively bind DNA with Pbx1a, despite the presence

	Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for the discovery of

	cis-regulatory elements in the genomes of several organisms including

	the adult, which includes the dorsal haltere, an appendage required
	for flight, and the ventral T3 leg. Ubx mutants show homeotic transformations
	of the T3 leg towards the identity of the T2 leg and the haltere

	heart diseases have not been fully demonstrated. Here, we show that
	interactions between alleles of 3 Pbx genes, which encode homeodomain
	transcription factors, are sufficient to determine the phenotypic
	presentation of congenital heart diseases in mice. A major role is
	served by Pbx1, whose inactivation results in persistent truncus
	arteriosus. Reduction or absence of Pbx2 or Pbx3 leads to Pbx1 haploinsufficiency
	and specific malformations that resemble tetralogy of Fallot, overriding
	aorta with ventricular septal defect, and bicuspid aortic valves.
	Disruption of Meis1, which encodes a Pbx DNA-binding partner, results
	in cardiac anomalies that resemble those caused by Pbx mutations.
	Each of the observed cardiac defects represents developmental abnormalities
	affecting distinct stages of cardiac outflow tract development and
	corresponds to specific types of human congenital heart disease.
	Thus, varied deficiencies in the Pbx gene family produce a full spectrum

	either PBX or MEIS subclasses of homeodomain proteins. This interaction
	can increase the binding specificity and transcriptional effectiveness
	of the HOX partner. Here we show that specific members of both PBX
	and MEIS subclasses form a multimeric complex with the pancreatic
	homeodomain protein PDX1 and switch the nature of its transcriptional
	activity. The two activities of PDX1 are exhibited through the 10-bp
	B element of the transcriptional enhancer of the pancreatic elastase
	I gene (ELA1). In pancreatic acinar cells the activity of the B element
	requires other elements of the ELA1 enhancer; in beta-cells the B
	element can activate a promoter in the absence of other enhancer
	elements. In acinar cell lines the activity is mediated by a complex
	comprising PDX1, PBX1b, and MRG1 (MEIS2). In contrast, beta-cell
	lines are devoid of PBX1b and MRG1, so that a trimeric complex does
	not form, and the beta-cell-type activity is mediated by PDX1 without
	PBX1b and MRG1. The presence of specific nuclear isoforms of PBX
	and MEIS is precisely regulated in a cell-type-specific manner. The
	beta-cell-type activity can be detected in acinar cells if the B
	element is altered to retain binding of PDX1 but prevent binding
	of the PDX1-PBX1b-MRG1 complex. These observations suggest that association
	with PBX and MEIS partners controls the nature of the transcriptional
	activity of the organ-specific PDX1 transcription factor in exocrine

	the gastrula stage vertebrate embryo and formation of the three germ
	layers. Despite its important role during development, there are
	still relatively few genes with specific expression in the organizer
	and its derivatives. Foxa2 is a forkhead transcription factor that
	is absolutely required for formation of the mammalian equivalent
	of the organizer, the node, the axial mesoderm and the definitive
	endoderm (DE). However, the targets of Foxa2 during embryogenesis,
	and the molecular impact of organizer loss on the gastrula embryo,
	have not been well defined.To identify genes specific to the Spemann/Mangold
	organizer, we performed a microarray-based screen that compared wild-type
	and Foxa2 mutant embryos at late gastrulation stage (E7.5). We could
	detect genes that were consistently down-regulated in replicate pools
	of mutant embryos versus wild-type, and these included a number of
	known node and DE markers. We selected 314 genes without previously
	published data at E7.5 and screened for expression by whole mount
	in situ hybridization. We identified 10 novel expression patterns
	in the node and 5 in the definitive endoderm. We also found significant
	reduction of markers expressed in secondary tissues that require
	interaction with the organizer and its derivatives, such as cardiac
	mesoderm, vasculature, primitive streak, and anterior neuroectoderm.The
	genes identified in this screen represent novel Spemann/Mangold organizer
	genes as well as potential Foxa2 targets. Further investigation will
	be needed to define these genes as novel developmental regulatory
	factors involved in organizer formation and function. We have placed
	these genes in a Foxa2-dependent genetic regulatory network and we
	hypothesize how Foxa2 may regulate a molecular program of Spemann/Mangold
	organizer development. We have also shown how early loss of the organizer
	and its inductive properties in an otherwise normal embryo, impacts
	on the molecular profile of surrounding tissues.},

	the transcriptome and several histone modifications across the genome
	during defined stages of cardiac differentiation. We find distinct
	chromatin patterns that are coordinated with stage-specific expression
	of functionally related genes, including many human disease-associated
	genes. Moreover, we discover a novel preactivation chromatin pattern
	at the promoters of genes associated with heart development and cardiac
	function. We further identify stage-specific distal enhancer elements
	and find enriched DNA binding motifs within these regions that predict
	sets of transcription factors that orchestrate cardiac differentiation.
	Together, these findings form a basis for understanding developmentally
	regulated chromatin transitions during lineage commitment and the
	molecular etiology of congenital heart disease.},

	soluble DNA-independent protein-protein complexes exist in mammals.
	The extent of HOX/TALE superclass interactions, protein structural
	requirements, and sites of in vivo cooperative interaction have not
	been fully explored. We show that Hoxa13 and Hoxd13 expression does
	not overlap with that of Meis1-3 in the developing limb; however,
	coexpression occurs in the developing male and female reproductive
	tracts (FRTs). We demonstrate that both HOXA13 and HOXD13 associate
	with MEIS1B in mammalian and yeast cells, and that HOXA13 can interact
	with all MEIS proteins but not more diverged TALE superclass members.
	In addition, the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of MEIS1A (18 amino acids)
	and MEIS1B (93 amino acids) are necessary for HOXA13 interaction;
	for MEIS1B, this domain was also sufficient. We also show by yeast
	two-hybrid assay that MEIS proteins can interact with anterior HOX
	proteins, but for some, additional N-terminal MEIS sequences are
	required for interaction. Using deletion mutants of HOXA13 and HOXD13,
	we provide evidence for multiple HOX peptide domains interacting
	with MEIS proteins. These data suggest that HOX:MEIS interactions
	may extend to non-AbdB-like HOX proteins in solution and that differences
	may exist in the MEIS peptide domains utilized by different HOX groups.
	Finally, the capability of multiple HOX domains to interact with
	MEIS C-terminal sequences implies greater complexity of the HOX:MEIS
	protein-protein interactions and a larger role for variation of HOX
	amino-terminal sequences in specificity of function.},

	Our studies show that induction and maintenance of MLL transformation

	LSC potential, and determines LSC frequency by quantitatively regulating
	the extent of self-renewal, differentiation arrest, and cycling,

	Thus, TALE proteins are critical downstream effectors within an essential

	Here we show that the Meis1 and Meis2 homeoproteins are direct regulators

	in lens development, and Pax6 expression is elevated in lenses of
	Meis2-overexpressing transgenic mice. When expressed in embryonic
	lens ectoderm, dominant-negative forms of Meis down-regulate endogenous
	Pax6. These results contrast with those in Drosophila, where the

	factor-DNA association with higher sensitivity, specificity, and
	spatial resolution than ChIP-chip, it poses new challenges for statistical
	analysis that derive from the complexity of the biological systems
	characterized and from variability and biases in its sequence data.
	We propose a method called PICS (Probabilistic Inference for ChIP-seq)
	for identifying regions bound by transcription factors from aligned
	reads. PICS identifies binding event locations by modeling local
	concentrations of directional reads, and uses DNA fragment length
	prior information to discriminate closely adjacent binding events
	via a Bayesian hierarchical t-mixture model. It uses precalculated,
	whole-genome read mappability profiles and a truncated t-distribution
	to adjust binding event models for reads that are missing due to
	local genome repetitiveness. It estimates uncertainties in model
	parameters that can be used to define confidence regions on binding
	event locations and to filter estimates. Finally, PICS calculates
	a per-event enrichment score relative to a control sample, and can
	use a control sample to estimate a false discovery rate. Using published
	GABP and FOXA1 data from human cell lines, we show that PICS' predicted
	binding sites were more consistent with computationally predicted
	binding motifs than the alternative methods MACS, QuEST, CisGenome,
	and USeq. We then use a simulation study to confirm that PICS compares
