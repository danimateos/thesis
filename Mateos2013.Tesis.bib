   abstract = {The products of the mammalian Pbx and Drosophila exd genes are able to interact with Hox proteins specifically and to increase their DNA binding affinity and selectivity. In the accompanying paper we show that Pbx proteins exist as stable heterodimers with a novel homeodomain protein, Prep1. Here we show that Prep1-Pbx interaction presents novel structural features: it is independent of DNA binding and of the integrity of their respective homeodomains, and requires sequences in the N-terminal portions of both proteins. The Prep1-Pbx protein-protein interaction is essential for DNA-binding activity. Prep1-Pbx complexes are present in early mouse embryos at a time when Pbx is also interacting with Hox proteins. The use of different interaction surfaces could allow Pbx to interact with Prep1 and Hox proteins simultaneously. Indeed, we observe the formation of a ternary Prep1-Pbx1-HOXB1 complex on a HOXB1-responsive target in vitro. Interaction with Prep1 enhances the ability of the HOXB1-Pbx1 complex to activate transcription in a cooperative fashion from the same target. Our data suggest that Prep1 is an additional component in the transcriptional regulation by Hox proteins.},

   abstract = {The human transcription factor, UEF3, is important in regulating the activity of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) gene enhancer. The UEF3 DNA target site is a regulatory element in the promoters of several growth factor and protease genes. We reported previously that purified UEF3 is a complex of several subunits. In this paper we report the cloning of the cDNA of one of the subunits which encodes for a novel human homeodomain protein, which we have termed Prep1. The Prep1 homeodomain belongs to the TALE class of homeodomains, is most closely related to those of the TGIF and Meis1 proteins, and like these, recognizes a TGACAG motif. We further identify the other UEF3 subunit as a member of the Pbx protein family. Unlike other proteins known to interact with Pbx, Prep1 forms a stable complex with Pbx independent of DNA binding. Heterodimerization of Prep1 and Pbx results in a strong DNA binding affinity towards the TGACAG target site of the uPA promoter. Overall, these data indicate that Prep1 is a stable intracellular partner of Pbx in vivo.},

ORF and PCR analysis revealed a novel type of alternative splicing within the homeobox. The alternative splicing occurs such that two different homeodomains can be generated, which differ in their first 25 amino acids. ceh-25 is an orthologue of the vertebrate Meis genes and it shares a new conserved domain of 130 amino acids with them. A thorough analysis of all TALE homeobox genes was performed and a new classification is presented. Four TALE classes are identified in animals: PBC, MEIS, TGIF and IRO (Iroquois); two types in fungi: the mating type genes (M-ATYP) and the CUP genes; and two types in plants: KNOX and BEL. The IRO class has a new conserved motif downstream of the homeodomain. For the KNOX class, a conserved domain, the KNOX domain, was defined upstream of the homeodomain. Comparison of the KNOX domain and the MEIS domain shows significant sequence similarity revealing the existence of an archetypal group of homeobox genes that encode two associated conserved domains. Thus TALE homeobox genes were already present in the common ancestor of plants, fungi and animals and represent a branch distinct from the typical homeobox genes.},

At the same time, another paper identified the Drosophila gene homothorax (hth) as a homologue of the vertebrate MEIS genes, which prompted a reexamination of the sequences of the MEIS, KNOX (collectively named MEINOX) and PBC domains. Similarity of the complete MEINOX domain was found within the PBC domain. This suggests that the PBC class genes were also derived from the ancient MEINOX genes. Recently, it has been shown that the MEIS genes can interact with the Abd-B genes, whilst previous results have shown that the PBC genes interact with anterior Hox genes. This leads to the hypothesis that the duplication of an ancestral MEINOX gene into the PBC and MEIS genes happened at a point in time when the first two Hox cluster genes, an anterior one and a posterior one, emerged, and that subsequently these gene classes coevolved.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE: Several mutations that impair the development of blood lineages in the mouse also impair the formation of the lymphatic vasculature and its separation from the blood vasculature. However, the basis for these defects has remained unknown because the mutations characterized affect more than one blood lineage. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that megakaryocytes/platelets are required for the formation of the lymphatic vasculature and its separation from the blood vascular system. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized the vascular patterning defects of mice deficient for the homeodomain transcription factor Meis1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1), which completely lack megakaryocyte/platelets. Meis1 null embryos fail to separate the blood and lymphatic vasculature, showing blood-filled primary lymphatic sacs and superficial lymphatic vessels. To test the involvement of megakaryocytes/platelets in this phenotype, we generated megakaryocyte/platelet-specific deficient mice by targeted lineage ablation, without affecting other blood lineages. This model reproduces the lymphatic/blood vasculature separation defects observed in Meis1 mutants. A similar phenotype was induced by antibody-mediated ablation of circulating platelets in wild type mice. Strong association of platelets with vascular endothelium at regions of contact between lymphatic sacs and veins confirmed a direct role of platelets in the separation of the 2 vasculatures. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to their known protective function in the response accidental vascular injury, platelets are also required during embryonic lymphangiogenesis for the separation of the nascent lymphatic vasculature from blood vessels.},

   abstract = {Pbx1 is the product of a proto-oncogene originally discovered at the site of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias. It binds DNA as a complex with a broad subset of homeodomain proteins, but its contributions to hematopoiesis have not been established. This paper reports that Pbx1 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors during murine embryonic development and that its absence results in severe anemia and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 15 (E15) or E16. Definitive myeloerythroid lineages are present in Pbx1(-/-) fetal livers, but the total numbers of colony-forming cells are substantially reduced. Fetal liver hypoplasia reflects quantitative as well as qualitative defects in the most primitive multilineage progenitors and their lineage-restricted progeny. Hematopoietic stem cells from Pbx1(-/-) embryos have reduced colony-forming activity and are unable to establish multilineage hematopoiesis in competitive reconstitution experiments. Common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), the earliest known myeloerythroid-restricted progenitors, are markedly depleted in Pbx1(-/-) embryos at E14 and display clonogenic defects in erythroid colony formation. Comparative cell-cycle indexes suggest that these defects result largely from insufficient proliferation. Megakaryocyte- and erythrocyte-committed progenitors are also reduced in number and show decreased erythroid colony-forming potential. Taken together, these data indicate that Pbx1 is essential for the function of hematopoietic progenitors with erythropoietic potential and that its loss creates a proliferative constriction at the level of the CMP. Thus, Pbx1 is required for the maintenance, but not the initiation, of definitive hematopoiesis and contributes to the mitotic amplifications of progenitor subsets through which mature erythrocytes are generated.

To understand the in vivo role of Prep1, we have analyzed an embryonic lethal hypomorphic mutant mouse (Prep1(i/i)). Prep1(i/i) embryos die at embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) to birth with an overall organ hypoplasia, severe anemia, impaired angiogenesis, and eye anomalies, particularly in the lens and retina. The anemia correlates with delayed differentiation of erythroid progenitors and may be, at least in part, responsible for intrauterine death. At E14.5, Prep1 is present in fetal liver (FL) cMyb-positive cells, whose deficiency causes a marked hematopoietic phenotype. Prep1 is also localized to FL endothelial progenitors, consistent with the observed angiogenic phenotype. Likewise, at the same gestational day, Prep1 is present in the eye cells that bear Pax6, implicated in eye development. The levels of cMyb and Pax6 in FL and in the retina, respectively, are significantly decreased in Prep1(i/i) embryos, consistent with the hematopoietic and eye phenotypes. Concomitantly, Prep1 deficiency results in the overall decrease of protein levels of its related family member Meis1 and its partners Pbx1 and Pbx2. As both Prep1 and Meis interact with Pbx, the overall Prep1/Meis-Pbx DNA-binding activity is strongly reduced in whole Prep1(i/i) embryos and their organs. Our data indicate that Prep1 is an essential gene that acts upstream of and within a Pbx-Meis network that regulates multiple aspects of embryonic development.},

Here, we identified the binding sites for Hoxa9 and the Hox cofactor Meis1 on a genome-wide level and profiled their associated epigenetic modifications and transcriptional targets. Hoxa9 and the Hox cofactor Meis1 cobind at hundreds of highly evolutionarily conserved sites, most of which are distant from transcription start sites. These sites show high levels of histone H3K4 monomethylation and CBP/P300 binding characteristic of enhancers. Furthermore, a subset of these sites shows enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. Many Hoxa9 and Meis1 binding sites are also bound by PU.1 and other lineage-restricted transcription factors previously implicated in establishment of myeloid enhancers. Conditional Hoxa9 activation is associated with CBP/P300 recruitment, histone acetylation, and transcriptional activation of a network of proto-oncogenes, including Erg, Flt3, Lmo2, Myb, and Sox4. Collectively, this work suggests that Hoxa9 regulates transcription by interacting with enhancers of genes important for hematopoiesis and leukemia.},

The chimeric RNAs encode a protein that lacks 171 amino acids of E2A, including its DNA binding and dimerization motifs, but have instead a homeobox-related sequence from prl. Therefore, the production of a chimeric E2A-Prl protein may contribute to the acute lymphoblastic phenotype by directly altering the expression of genes normally responsive to the Prl homeoprotein.},

   abstract = {Hox genes encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors that pattern the body axes of animal embryos. It is well established that the exquisite DNA-binding specificity that allows different Hox proteins to specify distinct structures along the body axis is frequently dependent on interactions with other DNA-binding proteins which act as Hox cofactors. These include the PBC and MEIS classes of TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) homeodomain proteins. The PBC class comprises fly Extradenticle (Exd) and vertebrate Pbx homeoproteins, whereas the MEIS class includes fly Homothorax (Hth) and vertebrate Meis and Prep homeoproteins. Exd was first implicated as a Hox cofactor based on mutant phenotypes in the fly. In vertebrates, PBC and MEIS homeobox proteins play important roles in development and disease. In this review, we describe the evidence that these functions reflect a requirement for Pbx and Meis/Prep proteins as Hox cofactors. However, there is mounting evidence that, like in the fly, Pbx and Meis/Prep proteins function more broadly, and we also discuss how "Hox cofactors" function as partners for other, non-Hox transcription factors during development. Conversely, we review the evidence that Hox proteins have functions that are independent of Pbx and Meis/Prep cofactors and discuss the possibility that other proteins may participate in the DNA-bound Hox complex, contributing to DNA-binding specificity in the absence of, or in addition to, Pbx and Meis/Prep.},

Meis1 was mapped to a distinct location on proximal mouse chromosome 11, suggesting that it represents a novel locus. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids segregating human chromosomes allowed localization of MEIS1 to human chromosome 2p23-p12, in a region known to contain translocations found in human leukemias. Northern (RNA) blot analysis demonstrated that a Meis1 probe detected a 3.8-kb mRNA present in all BXH-2 tumors, whereas tumors containing integrations at the Meis1 locus expressed an additional truncated transcript. A Meis1 cDNA clone that encoded a novel member of the homeobox gene family was identified. The homeodomain of Meis1 is most closely related to those of the PBX/exd family of homeobox protein-encoding genes, suggesting that Meis1 functions in a similar fashion by cooperative binding to a distinct subset of HOX proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that altered expression of the homeobox gene Meis1 may be one of the events that lead to tumor formation in BXH-2 mice.},

   abstract = {TALE homeodomain proteins are an ancient subgroup within the group of homeodomain transcription factors that play important roles in animal, plant, and fungal development. We have extracted the full complement of TALE superclass homeobox genes from the genome projects of seven protostomes, seven deuterostomes, and Nematostella. This was supplemented with TALE homeobox genes from additional species and phylogenetic analyses were carried out with 276 sequences. We found 20 homeobox genes and 4 pseudogenes in humans, 21 genes in mouse, 8 genes in Drosophila, and 5 genes plus one truncated gene in Caenorhabditis elegans. Apart from the previously identified TALE classes MEIS, PBC, IRO, and TGIF, a novel class is identified, termed MOHAWK (MKX). Further, we show that the MEIS class can be divided into two families, PREP and MEIS. Prep genes have previously only been described in vertebrates but are lacking in Drosophila. Here we identify orthologues in other insect taxa as well as in the cnidarian Nematostella. In C. elegans, a divergent Prep protein has lost the homeodomain. Full-length multiple sequence alignment of the protostome and deuterostome sequences allowed us to identify several novel conserved motifs within the MKX, TGIF, and MEIS classes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed fast-evolving PBC class genes; in particular, some X-linked PBC genes in nematodes are subject to rapid evolution. In addition, several instances of gene loss were identified. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis provides a defining framework for the classification of animal TALE homeobox genes and the understanding of their evolution.},

   abstract = {During the development of multicellular organisms, gene expression must be tightly regulated, both spatially and temporally. One set of transcription factors that are important in animal development is encoded by the homeotic (Hox) genes, which govern the choice between alternative developmental pathways along the anterior-posterior axis. Hox proteins, such as Drosophila Ultrabithorax, have low DNA-binding specificity by themselves but gain affinity and specificity when they bind together with the homeoprotein Extradenticle (or Pbxl in mammals). To understand the structural basis of Hox-Extradenticle pairing, we determine here the crystal structure of an Ultrabithorax-Extradenticle-DNA complex at 2.4 A resolution, using the minimal polypeptides that form a cooperative heterodimer. The Ultrabithorax and Extradenticle homeodomains bind opposite faces of the DNA, with their DNA-recognition helices almost touching each other. However, most of the cooperative interactions arise from the YPWM amino-acid motif of Ultrabithorax-located amino-terminally to its homeodomain-which forms a reverse turn and inserts into a hydrophobic pocket on the Extradenticle homeodomain surface. Together, these protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions define the general principles by which homeotic proteins interact with Extradenticle (or Pbx1) to affect development along the anterior-posterior axis of animals.},

   abstract = {We characterized a gene, extradenticle, which seems to interact with a specific subset of Drosophila homeo domain proteins, possibly affecting their target specificity. This interpretation is based on an examination of the zygotic and maternal effect phenotypes of extradenticle mutations. In embryos with reduced levels of extradenticle gene product, anterior and posterior segmental transformations occur. Segmental identity in Drosophila is mediated by the products of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes. These homeo domain proteins are thought to regulate different target genes specifically in each segment, resulting in different morphologies. extradenticle alters segmental identity without affecting the pattern of expression of homeotic genes. Genetic tests demonstrate that in extradenticle mutants, the homeotic proteins are functional and act in their normal segmental domains, yet segmental identities are altered. Even when homeotic proteins are ectopically expressed under the control of a heterologous promoter, extradenticle mutations affect their consequences. Thus, in the absence of sufficient extradenticle product, altered segmental morphology results from alteration of the functional consequences of specific homeo domain proteins, possibly through alterations in their target gene specificity. extradenticle is also expressed maternally. Complete removal of extradenticle, maternally and zygotically, leads to specific alterations in segmentation, many of which result from failure to maintain the expression of the homeo domain protein engrailed.},

   abstract = {extradenticle (exd) and the homeotic selector proteins together establish segmental identities by coordinately regulating the expression of downstream target genes. The inappropriate expression of these targets in exd mutant embryos results in homeotic transformations and aberrant morphogenesis. Here we examine the role of exd in adult development by using genetic mosaics and a hypomorphic exd allele caused by a point mutation in the homeodomain. exd continues to be essential for the specification of segmental identities, consistent with a continuing requirement for exd as cofactor of the homeotic selector proteins. Loss of exd results in the homeotic transformation of abdominal segments to an A5 or A6 segmental identity, the antenna and arista to leg, and the head capsule to dorsal thorax or notum. Proximal leg structures are particularly sensitive to the loss of exd, although exd does not affect the allocation of proximal positional values of the leg imaginal disc. Using heat-shocks to induce expression of a hsp70-exd fusion gene, we show that, in contrast to the homeotic selector genes, ubiquitously high levels of exd expression do not cause pattern abnormalities or segmental transformations.},

A combination of location and expression profiles was used to identify genes whose expression is directly controlled by Gal4 and Ste12 as cells respond to changes in carbon source and mating pheromone, respectively. The results identify pathways that are coordinately regulated by each of the two activators and reveal previously unknown functions for Gal4 and Ste12. Genome-wide location analysis will facilitate investigation of gene regulatory networks, gene function, and genome maintenance.},

MEIS1 is able to rescue hth mutant phenotypes and can induce the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of EXD in cell culture and Drosophila embryos. Thus, Meis1 is a murine homolog of hth. MEIS1/HTH also specifically binds to EXD with high affinity in vitro. These data suggest a novel and evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating HOX activity in which a direct protein-protein interaction between EXD and HTH results in EXD's nuclear translocation.},

Pbx1 contributions were investigated through characterization of Pbx1-deficient mice. Pbx1 mutants died at embryonic day 15/16 with severe hypoplasia or aplasia of multiple organs and widespread patterning defects of the axial and appendicular skeleton. An obligatory role for Pbx1 in limb axis patterning was apparent from malformations of proximal skeletal elements, but distal structures were unaffected. In addition to multiple rib and vertebral malformations, neural crest cell-derived skeletal structures of the second branchial arch were morphologically transformed into elements reminiscent of first arch-derived cartilages. Although the skeletal malformations did not phenocopy single or compound Hox gene defects, they were restricted to domains specified by Hox proteins bearing Pbx dimerization motifs and unaccompanied by alterations in Hox gene expression. In affected domains of limbs and ribs, chondrocyte proliferation was markedly diminished and there was a notable increase of hypertrophic chondrocytes, accompanied by premature ossification of bone. The pattern of expression of genes known to regulate chondrocyte differentiation was not perturbed in Pbx1-deficient cartilage at early days of embryonic skeletogenesis, however precocious expression of Col1a1, a marker of bone formation, was found. These studies demonstrate a role for Pbx1 in multiple developmental programs and reveal a novel function in co-ordinating the extent and/or timing of proliferation with terminal differentiation. This impacts on the rate of endochondral ossification and bone formation and suggests a mechanistic basis for most of the observed skeletal malformations.},

However, contrary to earlier in vitro evidence that histones may be absent from actively transcribed genes, we show directly, by immunoprecipitation of in vivo-crosslinked chromatin fragments, that at least histone H4 remains bound to hsp70 DNA in vivo, irrespective of its rate of transcription. The formaldehyde-based in vivo mapping techniques described in this work are generally applicable, and can be used both to probe protein-DNA interactions within specific genes and to determine the genomic location of specific chromosomal proteins.},
