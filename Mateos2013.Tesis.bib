  abstract = {Homeodomain proteins of the Meis subfamily are expressed dynamically
	in several organs during embryogenesis and exert potent regulatory
	activity through their interaction with Hox proteins and other transcription
	factors. Here we show that Meis1 is expressed in the hematopoietic
	stem cell (HSC) compartment in the fetal liver, and in the primary
	sites of definitive hematopoiesis, including the aorta-gonad-mesonephros
	(AGM) mesenchyme, the hemogenic embryonic arterial endothelium, and
	hematopoietic clusters within the aorta, vitelline, and umbilical
	arteries. We inactivated the Meis1 gene in mice and found that Meis1
	mutant mice die between embryonic days 11.5 and 14.5, showing internal
	hemorrhage, liver hypoplasia, and anemia. In Meis1 mutant mouse fetal
	liver and AGM, HSC compartments are severely underdeveloped and colony-forming
	potential is profoundly impaired. AGM mesenchymal cells expressing
	Runx1, an essential factor for definitive HSC specification, are
	almost absent in mutant mice. In addition, hematopoietic clusters
	in the dorsal aorta, vitelline, and umbilical arteries are reduced
	in size and number. These results show a requirement for Meis1 in
	the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo.
	Meis1 mutant mice also displayed complete agenesis of the megakaryocyte
	lineage and localized defects in vascular patterning, which may cause
	the hemorrhagic phenotype.},

	presents novel structural features: it is independent of DNA binding
	and of the integrity of their respective homeodomains, and requires
	sequences in the N-terminal portions of both proteins. The Prep1-Pbx
	protein-protein interaction is essential for DNA-binding activity.
	Prep1-Pbx complexes are present in early mouse embryos at a time
	when Pbx is also interacting with Hox proteins. The use of different
	interaction surfaces could allow Pbx to interact with Prep1 and Hox
	proteins simultaneously. Indeed, we observe the formation of a ternary
	Prep1-Pbx1-HOXB1 complex on a HOXB1-responsive target in vitro. Interaction
	with Prep1 enhances the ability of the HOXB1-Pbx1 complex to activate
	transcription in a cooperative fashion from the same target. Our

	The UEF3 DNA target site is a regulatory element in the promoters

	we report the cloning of the cDNA of one of the subunits which encodes

	The Prep1 homeodomain belongs to the TALE class of homeodomains,
	is most closely related to those of the TGIF and Meis1 proteins,
	and like these, recognizes a TGACAG motif. We further identify the
	other UEF3 subunit as a member of the Pbx protein family. Unlike
	other proteins known to interact with Pbx, Prep1 forms a stable complex
	with Pbx independent of DNA binding. Heterodimerization of Prep1

	Similarity of the complete MEINOX domain was found within the PBC

	lineages in the mouse also impair the formation of the lymphatic
	vasculature and its separation from the blood vasculature. However,
	the basis for these defects has remained unknown because the mutations
	characterized affect more than one blood lineage. OBJECTIVE: We tested
	the hypothesis that megakaryocytes/platelets are required for the
	formation of the lymphatic vasculature and its separation from the
	blood vascular system. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized the
	vascular patterning defects of mice deficient for the homeodomain
	transcription factor Meis1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site
	1), which completely lack megakaryocyte/platelets. Meis1 null embryos
	fail to separate the blood and lymphatic vasculature, showing blood-filled
	primary lymphatic sacs and superficial lymphatic vessels. To test
	the involvement of megakaryocytes/platelets in this phenotype, we
	generated megakaryocyte/platelet-specific deficient mice by targeted
	lineage ablation, without affecting other blood lineages. This model
	reproduces the lymphatic/blood vasculature separation defects observed
	in Meis1 mutants. A similar phenotype was induced by antibody-mediated
	ablation of circulating platelets in wild type mice. Strong association
	of platelets with vascular endothelium at regions of contact between
	lymphatic sacs and veins confirmed a direct role of platelets in
	the separation of the 2 vasculatures. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to
	their known protective function in the response accidental vascular
	injury, platelets are also required during embryonic lymphangiogenesis
	for the separation of the nascent lymphatic vasculature from blood

	control regions of target genes. However, the bases for these selective
	DNA-protein interactions are not well defined. In this report, we
	have characterized the DNA binding specificities of three murine
	homeodomain proteins, Hox 7.1, Hox 1.5, and En-1. We have identified
	optimal DNA binding sites for each of these proteins by using a random
	oligonucleotide selection strategy. Comparison of the sequences of
	the selected binding sites predicted a common consensus site that
	contained the motif (C/G)TAATTG. The TAAT core was essential for
	DNA binding activity, and the nucleotides flanking this core directed
	binding specificity. Whereas variations in the nucleotides flanking
	the 5' side of the TAAT core produced modest alterations in binding
	activity for all three proteins, perturbations of the nucleotides
	directly 3' of the core distinguished the binding specificity of
	Hox 1.5 from those of Hox 7.1 and En-1. These differences in binding
	activity reflected differences in the dissociation rates rather than
	the equilibrium constants of the protein-DNA complexes. Differences

  abstract = {The genes of the homeotic complex (HOX) encode DNA binding homeodomain
	proteins that control developmental fates by differentially regulating
	the transcription of downstream target genes. Despite their unique
	in vivo functions, disparate HOX proteins often bind to very similar
	DNA sequences in vitro. Thus, a critical question is how HOX proteins
	select the correct sets of target genes in vivo. The homeodomain
	proteins encoded by the Drosophila extradenticle gene and its mammalian
	homologues, the pbx genes, contribute to HOX specificity by cooperatively
	binding to DNA with HOX proteins. For example, the HOX protein labial
	cooperatively binds with extradenticle protein to a 20-bp oligonucleotide
	that is sufficient to direct a labial-like expression pattern in
	Drosophila embryos. Here we have analyzed the protein-DNA interactions
	that are important for forming the labial-extradenticle-DNA complex.
	The data suggest a model in which labial and extradenticle, separated
	by only 4 bp, bind this DNA as a heterodimer in a head-to-tail orientation.
	We have confirmed several aspects of this model by characterizing
	extradenticle-HOX binding to mutant oligonucleotides. Most importantly,
	mutations in base pairs predicted to contact the HOX N-terminal arm
	resulted in a change in HOX preference in the heterodimer, from labial
	to Ultrabithorax. These results demonstrate that extradenticle prefers
	to bind cooperatively with different HOX proteins depending on subtle
	differences in the heterodimer binding site.},

	regulates their activity, nuclear localization, and likely, function
	in development. To understand the in vivo role of Prep1, we have
	analyzed an embryonic lethal hypomorphic mutant mouse (Prep1(i/i)).
	Prep1(i/i) embryos die at embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) to birth with
	an overall organ hypoplasia, severe anemia, impaired angiogenesis,
	and eye anomalies, particularly in the lens and retina. The anemia
	correlates with delayed differentiation of erythroid progenitors
	and may be, at least in part, responsible for intrauterine death.
	At E14.5, Prep1 is present in fetal liver (FL) cMyb-positive cells,
	whose deficiency causes a marked hematopoietic phenotype. Prep1 is
	also localized to FL endothelial progenitors, consistent with the
	observed angiogenic phenotype. Likewise, at the same gestational
	day, Prep1 is present in the eye cells that bear Pax6, implicated
	in eye development. The levels of cMyb and Pax6 in FL and in the
	retina, respectively, are significantly decreased in Prep1(i/i) embryos,
	consistent with the hematopoietic and eye phenotypes. Concomitantly,
	Prep1 deficiency results in the overall decrease of protein levels
	of its related family member Meis1 and its partners Pbx1 and Pbx2.
	As both Prep1 and Meis interact with Pbx, the overall Prep1/Meis-Pbx
	DNA-binding activity is strongly reduced in whole Prep1(i/i) embryos

	to development has the two-fold task of explaining how the genetic

	mutants in Drosophila has thrown some light on both problems. Experiments
	on genetic mosaics confirm the idea that the genetic information
	is expressed within the cell itself. The behaviour of those morphogenetic
	mutants in mosaics suggests the existence of at least two classes
	of morphogenetic genes. Genes of a first group (cyto-differentiation
	genes) would include those controlling cell behaviour relevant to
	morphogenesis and common to most developing systems: mitotic rate,
	mitotic orientation, cell recognition and cuticular differentiation.
	Those of a second group (selector genes) seem to control developmental
	pathways and share several operational characteristics. A functional
	scheme is advanced showing how selector genes may become activated
	and control development. We postulate that inductor molecules interfere
	with the products of activator genes which are selector specific.
	In this way signals extrinsic to the genome become translated into
	genetic ones. The activation, or repression, of selector genes occurs
	once in development and remains clonally irreversible. This, possibly,
	is the genetic basis of a stable state of determination. However,
	the products of these activated selector genes are required throughout
	subsequent development in order to maintain a certain pathway. They
	may function by activating in turn the corresponding cytodifferentiation
	genes leading to changes in developmental operations.},

  abstract = {The t(1;19) chromosomal translocation of pediatric pre-B cell leukemia
	produces chimeric oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1, which contains the N-terminal
	transactivation domain of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription
	factor, E2a, joined to the majority of the homeodomain protein, Pbx1.
	There are three Pbx family members, which bind DNA as heterodimers
	with both broadly expressed Meis/Prep1 homeo-domain proteins and
	specifically expressed Hox homeodomain proteins. These Pbx heterodimers
	can augment the function of transcriptional activators bound to adjacent
	elements. In heterodimers, a conserved tryptophan motif in Hox proteins
	binds a pocket on the surface of the Pbx homeodomain, while Meis/Prep1
	proteins bind an N-terminal Pbx domain, raising the possibility that
	the tryptophan-interaction pocket of the Pbx component of a Pbx-Meis/Prep1
	complex is still available to bind trypto-phan motifs of other transcription
	factors bound to flanking elements. Here, we report that Pbx-Meis1/Prep1
	binds DNA cooperatively with heterodimers of E2a and MyoD, myogenin,
	Mrf-4 or Myf-5. As with Hox proteins, a highly conserved tryptophan
	motif N-terminal to the DNA-binding domains of each myogenic bHLH
	family protein is required for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx-Meis1/Prep1.
	In vivo, MyoD requires this tryptophan motif to evoke chromatin remodeling
	in the Myogenin promoter and to activate Myogenin transcription.
	Pbx-Meis/Prep1 complexes, therefore, have the potential to cooperate
	with the myogenic bHLH proteins in regulating gene transcription.},

  abstract = {E2a-Pbx1 is a chimeric transcription factor oncoprotein produced by
	the t(1;19) translocation in human pre-B cell leukemia. Class I Hox
	proteins bind DNA cooperatively with both Pbx proteins and oncoprotein
	E2a-Pbx1, suggesting that leukemogenesis by E2a-Pbx1 and Hox proteins
	may alter transcription of cellular genes regulated by Pbx-Hox motifs.
	Likewise, in murine myeloid leukemia, transcriptional coactivation
	of Meis1 with HoxA7/A9 suggests that Meis1-HoxA7/9 heterodimers may
	evoke aberrant gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that both
	Meis1 and its relative, pKnox1, dimerize with Pbx1 on the same TGATTGAC
	motif selected by dimers of Pbx proteins and unidentified partner(s)
	in nuclear extracts, including those from t(1;19) pre-B cells. Outside
	their homeodomains, Meis1 and pKnox1 were highly conserved only in
	two motifs required for cooperativity with Pbx1. Like the unidentified
	endogenous partner(s), both Meis1 and pKnox1 failed to dimerize significantly
	with E2a-Pbx1. The Meis1/pKnox1-interaction domain in Pbx1 resided
	predominantly in a conserved N-terminal Pbx domain deleted in E2a-Pbx1.
	Thus, the leukemic potential of E2a-Pbx1 may require abrogation of
	its interaction with members of the Meis and pKnox families of transcription
	factors, permitting selective targeting of genes regulated by Pbx-Hox
	complexes. In addition, because most motifs bound by Pbx-Meis1/pKnox1
	were not bound by Pbx1-Hox complexes, the leukemic potential of Meis1
	in myeloid leukemias may involve shifting Pbx proteins from promoters
	containing Pbx-Hox motifs to those containing Pbx-Meis motifs.},

	In embryos with reduced levels of extradenticle gene product, anterior

	are functional and act in their normal segmental domains, yet segmental
	identities are altered. Even when homeotic proteins are ectopically
	expressed under the control of a heterologous promoter, extradenticle
	mutations affect their consequences. Thus, in the absence of sufficient
	extradenticle product, altered segmental morphology results from
	alteration of the functional consequences of specific homeo domain
	proteins, possibly through alterations in their target gene specificity.
	extradenticle is also expressed maternally. Complete removal of extradenticle,

	is uniform and can suppress the segmental transformations of embryos

	uniform, later expression is modulated by the homeotic selector genes.
	These studies support the view that exd acts with the selector homeodomain

	possess a high degree of conservation with the human genome, so a
	thorough annotation of the mouse genome will be of significant value
	to understanding the function of the human genome. So far, most of
	the functional sequences in the mouse genome have yet to be found,
	and the cis-regulatory sequences in particular are still poorly annotated.
	Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for the discovery of
	these sequences, but on its own it cannot resolve their temporal
	and spatial functions. Recently, ChIP-Seq has been developed to identify
	cis-regulatory elements in the genomes of several organisms including

	we apply the same experimental approach to a diverse set of 19 tissues
	and cell types in the mouse to produce a map of nearly 300,000 murine
	cis-regulatory sequences. The annotated sequences add up to 11\%
	of the mouse genome, and include more than 70\% of conserved non-coding

	vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five
	vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes).
	Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of
	four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae),
	two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces.
	Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called
	phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov
	model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the
	data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate
	the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements
	based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\%
	of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration
	procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact
	Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18\%-37\%),
	and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47\%-68\%) genomes. From yeasts to
	vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological
	complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to
	lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups,
	the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are
	hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain
	properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer
	and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat
	different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated
	with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized
	regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding
	HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA
	secondary structure.},

	Drosophila Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), for example, is required
	for specifying the identity of the third thoracic (T3) segment of
	the adult, which includes the dorsal haltere, an appendage required
	for flight, and the ventral T3 leg. Ubx mutants show homeotic transformations
	of the T3 leg towards the identity of the T2 leg and the haltere
	towards the wing. All Hox genes, including Ubx, encode homeodomain
	containing transcription factors, raising the question of what target
	genes Ubx regulates to generate these adult structures. To address
	this question, we carried out whole genome ChIP-chip studies to identify
	all of the Ubx bound regions in the haltere and T3 leg imaginal discs,
	which are the precursors to these adult structures. In addition,
	we used ChIP-chip to identify the sites bound by the Hox cofactor,
	Homothorax (Hth). In contrast to previous ChIP-chip studies carried
	out in Drosophila embryos, these binding studies reveal that there
	is a remarkable amount of tissue- and transcription factor-specific
	binding. Analyses of the putative target genes bound and regulated
	by these factors suggest that Ubx regulates many downstream transcription
	factors and developmental pathways in the haltere and T3 leg. Finally,
	we discovered additional DNA sequence motifs that in some cases are
	specific for individual data sets, arguing that Ubx and/or Hth work
	together with many regionally expressed transcription factors to
	execute their functions. Together, these data provide the first whole-genome
	analysis of the binding sites and target genes regulated by Ubx to
	specify the morphologies of the adult T3 segment of the fly.},
