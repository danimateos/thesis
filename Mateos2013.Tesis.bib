  abstract = {homothorax (hth) is a Drosophila member of the Meis family of homeobox
	genes. hth function is required for the nuclear localization of the
	Hox cofactor Extradenticle (EXD). We show here that there is also
	a post-transcriptional control of HTH by exd: exd activity is required
	for the apparent stability of the HTH protein. In leg imaginal discs,
	hth expression is limited to the domain of exd function and this
	domain is complementary to the domain in which the Wingless (WG)
	and Decapentaplegic (DPP) signals are active. We demonstrate that
	WG and DPP act together through their targets Distal-less (Dll) and
	dachshund (dac) to restrict hth expression, and therefore EXD's nuclear
	localization, to the most proximal regions of the leg disc. Furthermore,
	there is a reciprocal repression exerted by HTH on these and other
	DPP and WG downstream targets that restricts their expression to
	non-hth-expressing cells. Thus, there exists in the leg disc a set
	of mutually antagonistic interactions between proximal cells, which
	we define as those that express hth, and distal cells, or those that
	do not express hth. In addition, we show that dac negatively regulates
	Dll. We suggest that these antagonistic relationships help to convert
	the WG and DPP activity gradients into discreet domains of gene expression
	along the proximodistal axis.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila PBC protein Extradenticle (Exd) is regulated at the
	level of its subcellular distribution: It is cytoplasmic in the absence
	of Homothorax (Hth), a Meis family member, and nuclear in the presence
	of Hth. Here we present evidence that, in the absence of Hth, Exd
	is exported from nuclei due to the activity of a nuclear export signal
	(NES). The activity of this NES is inhibited by the antibiotic Leptomycin
	B, suggesting that Exd is exported by a CRM1/exportin1-related export
	pathway. By analyzing the subcellular localization of Exd deletion
	mutants in imaginal discs and cultured cells, we identified three
	elements in Exd, a putative NES, a nuclear localization sequence
	(NLS), and a region required for Hth-mediated nuclear localization.
	This latter region coincides with a domain in Exd that binds Hth
	protein in vitro. When Exd is uncomplexed with Hth, the NES dominates
	over the NLS. When Exd is expressed together with Hth, or when the
	NES is deleted, Exd is nuclear. Thus, Hth is required to overcome
	the influence of the NES, possibly by inducing a conformational change
	in Exd. Finally, we provide evidence that Hth and Exd normally interact
	in the cytoplasm, and that Hth also has an NLS. We propose that in
	Exd there exists a balance between the activities of an NES and an
	NLS, and that Hth alters this balance in favor of the NLS.},

	(AGM) mesenchyme, the hemogenic embryonic arterial endothelium, and
	hematopoietic clusters within the aorta, vitelline, and umbilical

	mutant mice die between embryonic days 11.5 and 14.5, showing internal
	hemorrhage, liver hypoplasia, and anemia. In Meis1 mutant mouse fetal
	liver and AGM, HSC compartments are severely underdeveloped and colony-forming
	potential is profoundly impaired. AGM mesenchymal cells expressing
	Runx1, an essential factor for definitive HSC specification, are
	almost absent in mutant mice. In addition, hematopoietic clusters

	Meis1 mutant mice also displayed complete agenesis of the megakaryocyte

	the hypothesis that megakaryocytes/platelets are required for the
	formation of the lymphatic vasculature and its separation from the
	blood vascular system. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized the
	vascular patterning defects of mice deficient for the homeodomain
	transcription factor Meis1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site
	1), which completely lack megakaryocyte/platelets. Meis1 null embryos
	fail to separate the blood and lymphatic vasculature, showing blood-filled
	primary lymphatic sacs and superficial lymphatic vessels. To test
	the involvement of megakaryocytes/platelets in this phenotype, we
	generated megakaryocyte/platelet-specific deficient mice by targeted
	lineage ablation, without affecting other blood lineages. This model
	reproduces the lymphatic/blood vasculature separation defects observed
	in Meis1 mutants. A similar phenotype was induced by antibody-mediated
	ablation of circulating platelets in wild type mice. Strong association
	of platelets with vascular endothelium at regions of contact between
	lymphatic sacs and veins confirmed a direct role of platelets in
	the separation of the 2 vasculatures. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to
	their known protective function in the response accidental vascular
	injury, platelets are also required during embryonic lymphangiogenesis
	for the separation of the nascent lymphatic vasculature from blood

	DNA binding activity, and the nucleotides flanking this core directed
	binding specificity. Whereas variations in the nucleotides flanking
	the 5' side of the TAAT core produced modest alterations in binding
	activity for all three proteins, perturbations of the nucleotides
	directly 3' of the core distinguished the binding specificity of
	Hox 1.5 from those of Hox 7.1 and En-1. These differences in binding
	activity reflected differences in the dissociation rates rather than
	the equilibrium constants of the protein-DNA complexes. Differences

	select the correct sets of target genes in vivo. The homeodomain
	proteins encoded by the Drosophila extradenticle gene and its mammalian
	homologues, the pbx genes, contribute to HOX specificity by cooperatively

	The data suggest a model in which labial and extradenticle, separated

	We have confirmed several aspects of this model by characterizing

	the biochemical compositions of endogenous Pbx-containing complexes

	distinctive DNA binding specificities and cross-bind to a subset
	of Pbx-Hox sites, including those previously implicated as response
	elements for the execution of Pbx-dependent Hox programs in vivo.
	Chimeric oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 is unable to bind DNA with Meis1, due
	to the deletion of amino-terminal Pbx1 sequences following fusion
	with E2a. We conclude that Meis proteins are preferred in vivo DNA
	binding partners for wild-type Pbx1, a relationship that is circumvented

	Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the hexapeptide motif (IYPWMK)

	The Pbx homeo domain was necessary but not sufficient for cooperativity,

	site of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias. It binds DNA
	as a complex with a broad subset of homeodomain proteins, but its
	contributions to hematopoiesis have not been established. This paper
	reports that Pbx1 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors during
	murine embryonic development and that its absence results in severe
	anemia and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 15 (E15) or E16.
	Definitive myeloerythroid lineages are present in Pbx1(-/-) fetal
	livers, but the total numbers of colony-forming cells are substantially
	reduced. Fetal liver hypoplasia reflects quantitative as well as
	qualitative defects in the most primitive multilineage progenitors
	and their lineage-restricted progeny. Hematopoietic stem cells from
	Pbx1(-/-) embryos have reduced colony-forming activity and are unable
	to establish multilineage hematopoiesis in competitive reconstitution
	experiments. Common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), the earliest known
	myeloerythroid-restricted progenitors, are markedly depleted in Pbx1(-/-)
	embryos at E14 and display clonogenic defects in erythroid colony
	formation. Comparative cell-cycle indexes suggest that these defects
	result largely from insufficient proliferation. Megakaryocyte- and
	erythrocyte-committed progenitors are also reduced in number and
	show decreased erythroid colony-forming potential. Taken together,
	these data indicate that Pbx1 is essential for the function of hematopoietic
	progenitors with erythropoietic potential and that its loss creates
	a proliferative constriction at the level of the CMP. Thus, Pbx1
	is required for the maintenance, but not the initiation, of definitive
	hematopoiesis and contributes to the mitotic amplifications of progenitor
	subsets through which mature erythrocytes are generated. (Blood.

	which reflects their respective physical positions within the HOX

	to development has the two-fold task of explaining how the genetic
	information is selected and how it expresses itself in developmental
	operations. The genetic and developmental analysis of morphogenetic
	mutants in Drosophila has thrown some light on both problems. Experiments
	on genetic mosaics confirm the idea that the genetic information
	is expressed within the cell itself. The behaviour of those morphogenetic
	mutants in mosaics suggests the existence of at least two classes
	of morphogenetic genes. Genes of a first group (cyto-differentiation
	genes) would include those controlling cell behaviour relevant to
	morphogenesis and common to most developing systems: mitotic rate,
	mitotic orientation, cell recognition and cuticular differentiation.
	Those of a second group (selector genes) seem to control developmental
	pathways and share several operational characteristics. A functional
	scheme is advanced showing how selector genes may become activated
	and control development. We postulate that inductor molecules interfere
	with the products of activator genes which are selector specific.
	In this way signals extrinsic to the genome become translated into
	genetic ones. The activation, or repression, of selector genes occurs
	once in development and remains clonally irreversible. This, possibly,
	is the genetic basis of a stable state of determination. However,
	the products of these activated selector genes are required throughout
	subsequent development in order to maintain a certain pathway. They
	may function by activating in turn the corresponding cytodifferentiation
	genes leading to changes in developmental operations.},

	and specifies this domain of overlap. Both the position of CR3 within

	suggesting it has a common role in regulating the vertebrate HoxB

	depends on Deformed, Sex combs reduced, and Antennapedia but not

	(NLSs) within the PBX HD are masked by intramolecular contacts. In
	a screen to identify additional proteins directing PBX subcellular
	localization, we identified a fragment of murine nonmuscle myosin
	II heavy chain B (NMHCB). The interaction of NMHCB with PBX was verified
	by coimmunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence staining revealed
	colocalization of NMHCB with cytoplasmic PBX in the mouse embryo

	of the cytoplasmic retention function, the NMHCB fragment competes
	with MEIS1A to redirect PBX, and the fly PBX homologue EXD, to the
	cytoplasm of mammalian and insect cells. Interestingly, MEIS1A also
	localizes to the cytoplasm in the presence of the NMHCB fragment.
	These activities are largely independent of nuclear export. We show

	of Hox transcription factors are critical in controlling motor neuron
	fates along the rostrocaudal axis, exemplified by the precise pattern
	of limb innervation by more than fifty Hox-dependent motor pools.
	The mechanisms by which motor neuron diversity is constrained to
	limb levels are, however, not well understood. We show that a single
	Hox gene, Hoxc9, has an essential role in organizing the motor system
	through global repressive activities. Hoxc9 is required for the generation
	of thoracic motor columns, and in its absence, neurons acquire the
	fates of limb-innervating populations. Unexpectedly, multiple Hox
	genes are derepressed in Hoxc9 mutants, leading to motor pool disorganization
	and alterations in the connections by thoracic and forelimb-level
	subtypes. Genome-wide analysis of Hoxc9 binding suggests that this
	mode of repression is mediated by direct interactions with Hox regulatory
	elements, independent of chromatin marks typically associated with
	repressed Hox genes.},

	transactivation domain of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription
	factor, E2a, joined to the majority of the homeodomain protein, Pbx1.
	There are three Pbx family members, which bind DNA as heterodimers
	with both broadly expressed Meis/Prep1 homeo-domain proteins and
	specifically expressed Hox homeodomain proteins. These Pbx heterodimers
	can augment the function of transcriptional activators bound to adjacent
	elements. In heterodimers, a conserved tryptophan motif in Hox proteins
	binds a pocket on the surface of the Pbx homeodomain, while Meis/Prep1
	proteins bind an N-terminal Pbx domain, raising the possibility that
	the tryptophan-interaction pocket of the Pbx component of a Pbx-Meis/Prep1
	complex is still available to bind trypto-phan motifs of other transcription
	factors bound to flanking elements. Here, we report that Pbx-Meis1/Prep1
	binds DNA cooperatively with heterodimers of E2a and MyoD, myogenin,
	Mrf-4 or Myf-5. As with Hox proteins, a highly conserved tryptophan
	motif N-terminal to the DNA-binding domains of each myogenic bHLH
	family protein is required for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx-Meis1/Prep1.
	In vivo, MyoD requires this tryptophan motif to evoke chromatin remodeling

	proteins bind DNA cooperatively with both Pbx proteins and oncoprotein
	E2a-Pbx1, suggesting that leukemogenesis by E2a-Pbx1 and Hox proteins
	may alter transcription of cellular genes regulated by Pbx-Hox motifs.
	Likewise, in murine myeloid leukemia, transcriptional coactivation
	of Meis1 with HoxA7/A9 suggests that Meis1-HoxA7/9 heterodimers may
	evoke aberrant gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that both
	Meis1 and its relative, pKnox1, dimerize with Pbx1 on the same TGATTGAC
	motif selected by dimers of Pbx proteins and unidentified partner(s)
	in nuclear extracts, including those from t(1;19) pre-B cells. Outside

	predominantly in a conserved N-terminal Pbx domain deleted in E2a-Pbx1.
	Thus, the leukemic potential of E2a-Pbx1 may require abrogation of

	Here, we identify a putative Hox-Pbx responsive cis-regulatory sequence,
	which resides in the coding sequence of Hoxa2 and is an important
	component of Hoxa2 regulation in rhombomere (r) 4. By using cell
	transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we

	also show that the Hox-Pbx element cooperates with a previously reported
	Hoxa2 r4 intronic enhancer and that its integrity is required to
	drive specific reporter gene expression in r4 upon electroporation
	in the chick embryo hindbrain. Thus, both intronic as well as exonic
	regulatory sequences are involved in Hoxa2 segmental regulation in
	the developing r4. Finally, we found that the Hox-Pbx exonic element
	is embedded in a larger 205-bp long ultraconserved genomic element
	(UCE) shared by all vertebrate genomes. In this respect, our data
	further support the idea that extreme conservation of UCE sequences

	HOX proteins bind DNA cooperatively with members of the PBC family
	of TALE-type homeodomain proteins, which includes human Pbx1. Cooperative
	DNA binding between HOX and PBC proteins requires a residue N-terminal

	in sequence between anterior- and posterior-regulating HOX proteins.
	We report here the 1.9-A-resolution structure of a posterior HOX
	protein, HoxA9, complexed with Pbx1 and DNA, which reveals that the
	posterior Hox hexapeptide adopts an altered conformation as compared
	with that seen in previously determined anterior HOX/PBC structures.
	The additional nonspecific interactions and altered DNA conformation
	in this structure account for the stronger DNA-binding affinity and

  pages = {323},
  abstract = {RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured.
	A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is
	the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This
	issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome
	assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult
	to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second
	significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms
	of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from
	one or both ends of cDNA fragments.We present RSEM, an user-friendly
	software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from
	single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates,
	95\% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also
	simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software
	does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a
	de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript
	quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated
	and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to
	quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage
	of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we
	show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained
	with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand,
	estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes
	may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on
	the number of possible splice forms for each gene.RSEM is an accurate
	and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances
	from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference
	genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo
	transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable
	guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments
	with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

	does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes
	it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur
	frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment
	is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.We implemented
	Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package
	that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT),
	to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference
	sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps.
	BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing
	machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations
	on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately
	10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
	BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)

  abstract = {Genome-wide analyses of protein binding sites generate large amounts
	of data; a ChIP dataset might contain 10,000 sites. Unbiased motif
	discovery in such datasets is not generally feasible using current
	methods that employ probabilistic models. We propose an efficient
	method, GADEM, which combines spaced dyads and an expectation-maximization
	(EM) algorithm. Candidate words (four to six nucleotides) for constructing
	spaced dyads are prioritized by their degree of overrepresentation
	in the input sequence data. Spaced dyads are converted into starting
	position weight matrices (PWMs). GADEM then employs a genetic algorithm
	(GA), with an embedded EM algorithm to improve starting PWMs, to
	guide the evolution of a population of spaced dyads toward one whose
	entropy scores are more statistically significant. Spaced dyads whose
	entropy scores reach a pre-specified significance threshold are declared
	motifs. GADEM performed comparably with MEME on 500 sets of simulated
	"ChIP" sequences with embedded known P53 binding sites. The major
	advantage of GADEM is its computational efficiency on large ChIP
	datasets compared to competitors. We applied GADEM to six genome-wide
	ChIP datasets. Approximately, 15 to 30 motifs of various lengths
	were identified in each dataset. Remarkably, without any prior motif
	information, the expected known motif (e.g., P53 in P53 data) was
	identified every time. GADEM discovered motifs of various lengths
	(6-40 bp) and characteristics in these datasets containing from 0.5
	to >13 million nucleotides with run times of 5 to 96 h. GADEM can
	be viewed as an extension of the well-known MEME algorithm and is
	an efficient tool for de novo motif discovery in large-scale genome-wide
	data. The GADEM software is available at (www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/GADEM/).},

	large subset of Hox/HOM-C proteins containing a conserved pentapeptide

	The pentapeptide is essential for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx1.
	In this study, we identify structural determinants of Pbx1 that are

	Hox protein HoxA5. We demonstrate that the homeodomain of Pbx1 contains
	a surface that binds the pentapeptide motif and that the Pbx1 homeodomain
	is sufficient for cooperative DNA binding with a Hox protein. A sequence
	immediately C terminal to the Pbx1 homeodomain, which is highly conserved

	DNA binding by Pbx1 and also contributes to maximal cooperativity

	generally have very similar patterns of expression, and gene targeting
	experiments have shown that members of paralogy group 3 can functionally
	compensate for each other. Hence, distinct functions for individual
	members of this family may primarily depend upon differences in their
	expression domains. The earliest domains of expression of the Hoxa3
	and Hoxb3 genes in hindbrain rhombomeric (r) segments are transiently
	regulated by kreisler, a conserved Maf b-Zip protein, but the mechanisms
	that maintain expression in later stages are unknown. In this study,
	we have compared the segmental expression and regulation of Hoxa3
	and Hoxb3 in mouse and chick embryos to investigate how they are
	controlled after initial activation. We found that the patterns of
	Hoxa3 and Hoxb3 expression in r5 and r6 in later stages during mouse
	and chick hindbrain development were differentially regulated. Hoxa3
	expression was maintained in r5 and r6, while Hoxb3 was downregulated.
	Regulatory comparisons of cis-elements from the chick and mouse Hoxa3
	locus in both transgenic mouse and chick embryos have identified
	a conserved enhancer that mediates the late phase of Hoxa3 expression
	through a conserved auto/cross-regulatory loop. This block of similarity
	is also present in the human and horn shark loci, and contains two
	bipartite Hox/Pbx-binding sites that are necessary for its in vivo
	activity in the hindbrain. These HOX/PBC sites are positioned near
	a conserved kreisler-binding site (KrA) that is involved in activating
	early expression in r5 and r6, but their activity is independent
	of kreisler. This work demonstrates that separate elements are involved
	in initiating and maintaining Hoxa3 expression during hindbrain segmentation,
	and that it is regulated in a manner different from Hoxb3 in later
	stages. Together, these findings add further strength to the emerging
	importance of positive auto- and cross-regulatory interactions between
	Hox genes as a general mechanism for maintaining their correct spatial
	patterns in the vertebrate nervous system.},

	In embryos with reduced levels of extradenticle gene product, anterior

	extradenticle product, altered segmental morphology results from
	alteration of the functional consequences of specific homeo domain

	the MEIS-like protein PREP1. Paradoxically, removal of residues N-terminal
	to the PBX1A HD abolishes interactions with MEIS/PREP but allows
	nuclear accumulation of PBX1A. We use deletion mapping and fusion
	to green fluorescent protein to map two cooperative nuclear localization
	signals (NLSs) in the PBX HD. The results of DNA-binding assays and

	N-terminus binds to the HD and masks the two NLSs. In support of

	a change in conformation. We propose that MEIS family proteins induce

  abstract = {Pbx1 and a subset of homeodomain proteins collaboratively bind DNA
	as higher-order molecular complexes with unknown consequences for
	mammalian development. Pbx1 contributions were investigated through
	characterization of Pbx1-deficient mice. Pbx1 mutants died at embryonic
	day 15/16 with severe hypoplasia or aplasia of multiple organs and
	widespread patterning defects of the axial and appendicular skeleton.
	An obligatory role for Pbx1 in limb axis patterning was apparent
	from malformations of proximal skeletal elements, but distal structures
	were unaffected. In addition to multiple rib and vertebral malformations,
	neural crest cell-derived skeletal structures of the second branchial
	arch were morphologically transformed into elements reminiscent of
	first arch-derived cartilages. Although the skeletal malformations
	did not phenocopy single or compound Hox gene defects, they were
	restricted to domains specified by Hox proteins bearing Pbx dimerization
	motifs and unaccompanied by alterations in Hox gene expression. In
	affected domains of limbs and ribs, chondrocyte proliferation was
	markedly diminished and there was a notable increase of hypertrophic
	chondrocytes, accompanied by premature ossification of bone. The
	pattern of expression of genes known to regulate chondrocyte differentiation
	was not perturbed in Pbx1-deficient cartilage at early days of embryonic
	skeletogenesis, however precocious expression of Col1a1, a marker
	of bone formation, was found. These studies demonstrate a role for
	Pbx1 in multiple developmental programs and reveal a novel function
	in co-ordinating the extent and/or timing of proliferation with terminal
	differentiation. This impacts on the rate of endochondral ossification
	and bone formation and suggests a mechanistic basis for most of the
	observed skeletal malformations.},

	The Meis1 homeobox gene has 44\% identity to Pbx within the homeodomain
	and was identified as a common site of viral integration in myeloid
	leukemias arising in BXH-2 mice. These integrations result in constitutive

	by viral integration in the same BXH-2 leukemias, suggesting a biological
	synergy between these two distinct classes of homeodomain proteins

	protein physically interacts with Meis1 proteins by forming heterodimeric
	binding complexes on a DNA target containing a Meis1 site (TGACAG)

	Previous studies have demonstrated that HOX-9 and HOX-10 paralog

	to form in vitro cooperative DNA binding complexes with either the
	PBX or MEIS protein. Furthermore, PBX and MEIS proteins have been

	MEIS1 enhances in vitro HOXA9-PBX protein complex formation in the
	absence of DNA and forms a trimeric electrophoretic mobility shift
	assay (EMSA) complex with these proteins on an oligonucleotide containing
	a PBX-HOXA9 site. Myeloid cell nuclear extracts produce EMSA complexes
	which appear to contain HOXA9, PBX2, and MEIS1, while immunoprecipitation
	of HOXA9 from these extracts results in coprecipitation of PBX2 and
	MEIS1. In myeloid cells, HOXA9, MEIS1, and PBX2 are all strongly
	expressed in the nucleus, where a portion of their signals are colocalized
	within nuclear speckles. However, cotransfection of HOXA9 and PBX2
	with or without MEIS1 minimally influences transcription of a reporter
	gene containing multiple PBX-HOXA9 binding sites. Taken together,
	these data suggest that in myeloid leukemia cells MEIS1 forms trimeric

	Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for the discovery of

	cis-regulatory elements in the genomes of several organisms including

	we apply the same experimental approach to a diverse set of 19 tissues

	cis-regulatory sequences. The annotated sequences add up to 11\%
	of the mouse genome, and include more than 70\% of conserved non-coding
	sequences. We define tissue-specific enhancers and identify potential
	transcription factors regulating gene expression in each tissue or

	motif which confers sequence specific DNA binding. Unexpectedly,
	the well conserved structural homology between the HD and the prokaryotic
	helix-turn-helix proteins contrasts with their divergent types of

	helix has assumed the role that the N-terminus of the prokaryotic

	the HD appears also capable of recognizing DNA in an alternative
	way and its specificity in vivo may be modified by regions outside
	the helix-turn-helix motif. We propose that this intrinsic complexity
	of the HD, as well as its frequent association with other DNA binding
	domains, explains the functional specificity achieved by genes encoding
	highly related HDs.},

	12 vertebrate species in combination with detailed regulatory analyses
	in mouse and chicken embryos to characterize the mechanistic basis
	for the regulation of Hoxa2 in rhombomere (r) 4. A highly conserved
	region in the Hoxa2 intron functions as an r4 enhancer. In vitro
	binding studies demonstrate that within the conserved region three
	bipartite Hox/Pbx binding sites (PH1-PH3) in combination with a single
	binding site for Pbx-Prep/Meis (PM) heterodimers co-operate to regulate
	enhancer activity in r4. Mutational analysis reveals that these sites
	are required for activity of the enhancer, suggesting that the r4
	enhancer from Hoxa2 functions in vivo as a Hox-response module in
	combination with the Hox cofactors, Pbx and Prep/Meis. Furthermore,
	this r4 enhancer is capable of mediating a response to ectopic HOXB1
	expression in the hindbrain. These findings reveal that Hoxa2 is
	a target gene of Hoxb1 and permit us to develop a gene regulatory
	network for r4, whereby Hoxa2, along with Hoxb1, Hoxb2 and Hoxa1,
	is integrated into a series of auto- and cross-regulatory loops between
	Hox genes. These data highlight the important role played by direct
	cross-talk between Hox genes in regulating hindbrain patterning.},

  abstract = {ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel

	factor-DNA association with higher sensitivity, specificity, and
	spatial resolution than ChIP-chip, it poses new challenges for statistical
	analysis that derive from the complexity of the biological systems
	characterized and from variability and biases in its sequence data.
	We propose a method called PICS (Probabilistic Inference for ChIP-seq)
	for identifying regions bound by transcription factors from aligned
	reads. PICS identifies binding event locations by modeling local
	concentrations of directional reads, and uses DNA fragment length
	prior information to discriminate closely adjacent binding events
	via a Bayesian hierarchical t-mixture model. It uses precalculated,
	whole-genome read mappability profiles and a truncated t-distribution
	to adjust binding event models for reads that are missing due to
	local genome repetitiveness. It estimates uncertainties in model
	parameters that can be used to define confidence regions on binding
	event locations and to filter estimates. Finally, PICS calculates
	a per-event enrichment score relative to a control sample, and can
	use a control sample to estimate a false discovery rate. Using published
	GABP and FOXA1 data from human cell lines, we show that PICS' predicted
	binding sites were more consistent with computationally predicted
	binding motifs than the alternative methods MACS, QuEST, CisGenome,
	and USeq. We then use a simulation study to confirm that PICS compares
	favorably to these methods and is robust to model misspecification.},
